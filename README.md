 Something you need https on your local machine to test some functionality of your application, like payment system but some of them require a valid https. Like stripe. And you can’t use localhost to request a certificate from issuer like Let's Encrypt. So your option is to create a self signed CA. This tool make it easy. 
---

Just clone this repository by run this command: `git clone git@github.com:madeny/lhttps.git` from terminal

* To use it just run : `php lh create domain.com`
* If you wish to add your rootCA.pem to your Mac OS trusted certificate. Use the a flag `--a` right after domain.com

Your `domain.com.ssl.key` and `domain.com.ssl.crt` will in `cert/live` directory

Just update your nginx config with       
`ssl_certificate ‘path/to/‘domain.com.ssl.crt; # `   
`ssl_certificate_key ‘path/to’/domain.com.ssl.key;`


*Right now only OSX and Ubuntu are support to create Certificate*
*But only Mac OSX are support to automatically add your Root Certificate Authority (CA) to the Trusted list*

### Todo Next:

- [ ] Full support for ubuntu
- [ ] Support for Windows
- [ ] Auto deploy certificate for Nginx
- [ ] Auto deploy certificate for Apache
- [ ] Auto deploy certificate for Node.js
